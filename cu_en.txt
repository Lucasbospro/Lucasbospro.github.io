11.2 Specific rules

In addition to global rules in 11.1, some prohibited conducts are specific to the Game.

(a) Cheat
- Cheating (aka Hack)
- Cheating on an alt account
- Asking for cheats
- Giving out cheats

(b) Chat	
- Spam/Flood
- Caps-lock abuse
- Advertising
- General vulgarity
- Inappropriate or vulgar links
- Severe insulting
- Insults to the staff
- Misleading players
- Provocation
- Promoting trollish topics
- Xenophobia
- Wrong languages in chat

(c) Accounts	
- Sentinel/Mod/Admin Impersonation

(d) Maps

(e) Totem	
- Offensive Totem
- Crash Totem

(f) Evasion	
- Mute evasion (Mute : prevents you to speak on the in game chat box) 
- Ban evasion (Ban : prevents you to access to the game)
Evading a ban or mute will result in a higher punishment. If you feel that you were punished unfairly it is best to contact a moderator via the forum.

(g) Voteban	
- Voteban abuse with your tribe/friends
- Voteban abuse with the entire room, group of players from the room
- Using voteban as a game
The command /ban <nick> is a very useful command that allows you to punish some players for minor offenses by yourself. It shouldn't be used indiscriminately or for fun; it's not here to resolve conflicts or to punish each newbie shaman. Forming a group or tribe to purposely invade a room and ban any random player for no reason will lead to a ban. Abusing the voteban command in this manner is not advised.
Using the /ban command for "lotteries" will always result in a ban against the people abusing the voteban command.

(h) Others	
- Glitch abuse (cf. 11.1.L)
- Crashing a room (as shaman)
- Inappropriate tribe name
- Leaking/Sharing private information relevant to the game

NB:
Vulgar / Inappropriate: Please refer to 11.1
Crash map/totem/shaman: Can cause other players to lag or even crash a room (cf. 11.1) 
Phishing: Any method of obtaining in-game items, cheese or fraises outside of the game is illegal. These illegal sources often require players to provide their username, password and e-mails, and create a huge security risk.
These websites are often an imitation of the real website and are controlled by a malicious person. If the user enters any personal information, they will be transmitted directly to the scammer.
Upon discovery of any player promoting or using these illegal websites, we will take serious action. Atelier 801 and Transformice are in no way affiliated with these website and don’t support them. 
Please report any players advertising or using a phishing website. 

11.3 Penalties

Atelier 801 SARL may take any actions and impose any penalties we deem necessary to discourage and punish any violation of these terms or any other illegal or inappropriate conduct, all without prior notice or warning. The determination as to whether a violation has occurred and who is responsible for such act is solely within Atelier 801 SARL's discretion, and is based on what we deem best for the community and the Website.

Violation of the rules displayed in 11.1 and 11.2 will be punished by either a mute(1), un ban(2), or even a permanent ban depending of the gravity and recurrence of these conducts.
